  Looking for: software embedded M0 or M4 - temperature
  sensor by Adafruit T-something like a T-15 - it is
  analog enough to measure directly on the multimeter.
  
  Software would be Arduino IDE, possibly.
  
  Target was housed in large plastic enclosure iirc.
  Maybe small one.  May or may not pimoroni dotstar.
