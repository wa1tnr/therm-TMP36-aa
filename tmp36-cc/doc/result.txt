With 169b28f28863f7 committed, the device performs well,
but not on some USB batteries (5 VDC).

The noise generated by the cylinder style USB battery
used during testing was enough to change the output of
the TMP36 sensor in a way that made it an unreliable
source of temperature information.

The flat USB pack, on the other hand, produced a steady
value from the sensor.

Metering: the PWM signal applied to the meter movement
was of sufficient range to bring the needle back to
origin (wrap-around) and then some, on both ends of
the scale.  The error was not much; a small adjustment
to scale will help keep the needle within the desired
range (some 52 - 12 to 52 + 12 degrees F).

The red/green/blue RGB regime is working very well, and
is presently scaled as:

Red: 30+ on the meter (incl. overrange way low on the
next range upwards) for WARM.

Green: 25 to 29 or so.

Blue:  below 25.

Those are meter readings taken by the human, and are
mapped by a map() function to PWM values that exhibit
these numbers as shown on the meter (68k ohms inline
with the positive (+) wire of the meter movement - some
50 uA full-scale (native).
